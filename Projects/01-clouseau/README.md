An email from a potential client:

> Agent, 
>
> It was so nice to meet you at the water shed event and learn
about your skills in data analysis. 
We would like to take some next steps to see if working 
together would make sense for both parties.  
>
> Like I mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power
of data analytics to help us optimize our approach in finding
organizations in SLC to partner with.  
>
> Watershed Moment Utah (WMU) works with organizations like 
schools, churches and businesses to help them find ways to 
increase efficient water usage and reduce waste.  
>
> Where we would like to solicit your help is to use water usage
data, which as I'm sure you know is freely available from the city, 
to help us find which areas we should be targeting. We're also
interested in any interesting points you find, like if a certain
kind of organization is more likely to consume water, etc. I'm sure 
those would be very beneficial to us.
>
> The ball is in your court now -- do you think this would be
feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind
of engagement would make sense for all of us going forward.
